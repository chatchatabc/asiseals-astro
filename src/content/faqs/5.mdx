name: Do seal faces have to be lubricated? Can they run dry?

The graphite in the carbon/graphite face is a natural lubricant. In operation the graphite separates from the mixture and transfers to the hard face. This means that the seal face combination you are normally running is carbon on graphite. The hard face is just some place to put the graphite.

Moisture must be present for the graphite to separate from the carbon/graphite mixture.

Running dry means higher heat at the faces. If you are using a good unfilled carbon/graphite (and you should be!), the faces are not going to be your problem. The elastomer and the product you are sealing can be very sensitive to a temperature change in the stuffing box, or an increase of temperature at the seal faces.
