name: Do seal faces have to be kept cool?

Most carbons and hard faces can tolerate a lot of heat. The elastomer (rubber parts) are the parts you have to watch. They are the most sensitive to a change in stuffing box temperature, especially if they are positioned in the seal faces.

Hydraulically-balanced seals generate very little heat between the faces.

Unbalanced seals usually require cooling because of the excessive heat they can generate.

Some face combinations generate more heat than others. Two hard faces are an example.

Some seal materials conduct heat better than others. Ceramic is a poor heat conductor and carbon is not much better. Tungsten carbide and silicone carbide are excellent conductors of heat.
