name: Do seals have to leak?
order: 9
---

- Any good quality mechanical seal should run without visible leakage
- Single, stationary (the springs do not rotate), hydraulically-balanced mechanical seals can pass a fugitive emission test as long as the rotating portion of the seal is designed to be located square to the shaft.
- Rotating seals (the springs rotate with the shaft) seldom pass a fugitive emission test. They are too sensitive to various forms of misalignment.
- Cartridge mounted stationary seals usually fail fugitive emission testing because the set screwing of the cartridge to the shaft prevents the rotating face from positioning itself square to the shaft. Some seal companies offer some types of a self-aligning design to solve this problem.
