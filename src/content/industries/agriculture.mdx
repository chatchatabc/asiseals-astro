Agricultural machinery is frequently subjected to harsh climatic conditions and humidity. Manufacturers and end-users integrate quality sealing systems to minimize the risk of machine outage or failure, as well as the resulting increase in equipment costs and loss of profits, to achieve and maintain these qualities.
