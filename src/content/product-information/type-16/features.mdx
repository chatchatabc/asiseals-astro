**A. The Crimped Head Design**

a) By eliminating contact between the seal ring and the metal shell, Advantage Seal are capable of operating at higher pressure levels and faster shaft speeds.

b) With the seal ring crimped securely in place, foreign particles and solids cannot intrude and dislodge the seal ring.

c) Manufactured without glue, our seals pose no questions of chemical compatibility or hassles with seal rings falling out during installation - even if they are installed nose-down.

**B. The Hex-Drive Distribution Advantage**

a) The hex-drive system evenly distributes torque around the seal head by incorporating a solid six-faced drive band that protects the diaphragm and eliminates the need for tangs and notches.

b) Inferior tang and notch drive systems commonly fail from broken tangs, loose engagements, and torn diaphragms. Th= Advantage Seal hex-drive system features a locking positive engagement that eliminates drive failure.

c) You can rely on Advantage Seal to endure, even during frequent start-and-stop operations and high break-away torque situations.
