Single face, unbalanced, independent of direction of rotation

Design standard: ISO3069 DIN24960 EN12756.

The pressure between the bellow and spring makes the sealing face closer to each other.

The bellow can compensate the radial runout of the shaft, improve the floatability of the seal ring, and push the seal ring, which is not only a secondary seal, but also a driving part of the seal ring.

The seal ring drives the bellow through L-shaped metal and spring to bear no torque, and the seal ring and rubber do not need to be bonded.

The shaft protection exceeds the length of the whole seal.

Can provide the widest selection of materials.
