single seal, unbalanced, independent of direction of rotation

design standard: ISO3069 DIN24960 EN12756

To absorb both breakout and running torque, the seal is designed with a drive band and drive notches that eliminate overstressing of bellows. Slippage is eliminated, protecting the shaft and sleeve from wear and scoring.

Automatic adjustment compensates for abnormal shaft-end play, run-out, primary ring wear and equipment tolerances. Uniform spring pressure compensates for axial and radial shaft movement.

Special balancing accommodates higher-pressure applications, greater operating speeds and lower wear.

Non-clogging, single-coil spring allows for greater dependability than multiple spring designs. Will not run foul due to fluid contact.

Low drive torque improves performance and reliability.
