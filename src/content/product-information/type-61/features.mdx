Single seal, unbalanced, independent of direction of rotation

Design standard: IS03069,DIN24960

A. Sealing Faces

Precision surface finish optimizes the survice life and reliability.Materials desighed to meet the broadest range of applications.

B. Flexible Bellows

Full convolution elastomer bellows provides maximum flexibility in compensating for shaft movement and wear.

C. Spring

Coil spring provides consistent face loading through extreme working conditions.

D. Positive Drive

Seal face torsional movement is restricted by dent and groove positive drive arrangement to minimize torsional stress on the flexible bellows.

E. Rotating Mating Ring

Rotating mating ring allows aoeration at higher speeds than comparable rotating seal head arrangements.
